<hr>

In this project instead of creating a react app with npm I used <b>pnpm</b> and <b>Vite</b>. Using <b>pnpm</b> and <b>Vite</b> makes it really faster to create and run the react app.

Special thanks to John Smilga because I used his data.js file to get the data I need.

### What I used in this project;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - import/export,
  - <b>Props</b>,
  - <b>useState</b>,
  - <b>useEffect</b>,
  - cleanup function,
  - Fecthing data with useEffect,
  - Conditional rendering,
  - <b>events</b> with React,
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>,
  - Destructuring props,
  - setInterval() method to automate the slides,
  - React icons.

### Functionalities
  * Loading page appears while fetching data from API,
  * If response status is 200 then the displays,
  * User can switch between quotes using left and right chevrons.
  * If user does not click chevrons, quotes will change in every 3 seconds.
